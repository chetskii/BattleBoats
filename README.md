## Rules

- Each player is assigned 3 boats.
- Each player will place their boats on the grid wherever they please.
- Once both players have placed their boats, the game begins.
- Player 1 will go first and players will alternate turns.
- Once a box selection is made, the players turn is over, successful or not.
- If player selects his own boat, player loses boat and turn.
- If player selects opponents boat player is awarded 1 point. Each boat hit = 1 point.
- If player selects an empty cell, no points awarded and turn goes to next player.
